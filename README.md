Source code for my mod that gives Sephiroth Cloud's nair


<b>If you're here wondering how I switched Sephiroth's sword from his left to his right hand, I'll give a brief rundown.</b>
<br>-Sephiroth actually has two swords, one for each hand. He uses the left for every move except final smash
<br>-I edited the animation in blender to hide the left-hand sword and show the right-hand one using this guide -> https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13906
<br>-For lines of code that use "swordl1", I simply replaced it with "swordr1"
